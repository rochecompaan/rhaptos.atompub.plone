Rhaptos AtomPub for Plone

    What it is:

        A barebones, implementation of the specification:
        http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023
        It supports:
        - POST (in development)
        - PUT (not done)
        - GET (not done)
        - DELETE (not done)

    Open issues:
        
        IRI conversion to URI

        - The spec allows for the use of IRI and URI as means to uniquely
        identify resources. It also requires that the conversion from IRI to URI
        be done as late as possible. As such it could be argued that the Plone
        implementation itself should be responsible for the conversion.
