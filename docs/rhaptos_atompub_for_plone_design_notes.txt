Rhaptos AtomPub for Plone

    What it is

        A barebones, implementation of the specification:
        http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023
        It supports:
        - POST (in development)
        - PUT (not done)
        - GET (not done)
        - DELETE (not done)

    
    Background reading

        NullResource in webdav package
        Izak's SWORD service implementation
        Archetypes BaseUnit
        Producst MimeTypesRegistry
        - classify method
        - define new mime type for atom xml (classifier)
        - implements IClassify + classify method
        - register method (IMimeType)

    AtomPub implemenation

        Atom mimetype register (MimeTypesRegistry.register)
        content type registry: atompub map to document
        what about AtomPub specific metadata?
        - custom classifier?
        - transfor AtomPub metdata into frc822 style metadata

        get content type form ct registry
        - register a new predicate
        - atompub+xml to point to ATDocument
        create the object
        - cf Products.CMFCore.PortaFolder.PUT_factory
        fix body in request
        call PUT on new object
        manipulate the response to change the body to that of the AtomPub
        result template

        IRI conversion to URI

        - The spec allows for the use of IRI and URI as means to uniquely
        identify resources. It also requires that the conversion from IRI to URI
        be done as late as possible. As such it could be argued that the Plone
        implementation itself should be responsible for the conversion.
